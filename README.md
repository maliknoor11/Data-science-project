# 🏠 Real Estate Data Collection and Cleaning Project

This project involves scraping property listings from Bayut and Hilal, cleaning and merging the data, engineering features, and applying regression models to predict real estate prices.

## 📂 Project Components
- `BayutFinal.ipynb`: Web scraping from bayut.om
- `HilalScraping.ipynb`: Web scraping from hilal.om
- `DataCleaning.ipynb`: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling

## ✅ Features
- `price_per_sqm` calculated
- `Property_Type` encoded
- Missing values handled with group medians
- Features scaled using MinMaxScaler

## 🔍 Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

## 📊 Evaluation
- MAE ≈ 67,000 with Random Forest
- R² ≈ 0.10 for Linear Regression

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Outlier removal
- Feature enrichment (e.g., location-based means)
